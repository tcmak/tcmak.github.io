<blockquote>
<p>Primera Accounting Services successfully fought for tax refunds for a client! During 2023 tax season, a client approached our company's tax consultant to file their tax return. The client explained that they had previously filed their 2018 income tax through an accountant in Chicago's Chinatown, but it triggered tax auditing, and thus they had not received any federal tax refund.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The client was extremely concerned as the refund was nearly two months of their income. Additionally, they were worried because the Statute of Limitations had already passed the three years Statute of Limitations for any refund.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The client mentioned that they had tried to negotiate with the IRS through their former accountant, but since the accountant was just a regular Tax Preparer, they were not qualified to represent the client in negotiation with the IRS and could only give vague responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the client sought help from our company's Enrolled Agent who immediately agreed to represent them in negotiations with the IRS. We worked diligently for over two months to negotiate with the IRS thru phone and face-to-face meetings. In the end, the IRS acknowledged its mistake. A full refund of $3384, plus $702.35 interest, was returned to the client. The check was received on July 19, 2023. Our company is delighted to have successfully obtained the tax refund for the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend everyone find a trustworthy and certified accountant who can genuinely assist you with your tax filings.</p>
